# beamerthemestralsund

A clone of the PowerPoint design of the University of Applied Sciences Stralsund for LaTeX Beamer.

This LaTeX beamer theme mimics the corporate design of the official PowerPoint template, which is no longer available at the universities website but still circulating in a broken version under the universities students.

As an alternative I developed this beamer theme. It is quite hacky in it's current state but usable.
