# beamerthemestralsund

A clone of the PowerPoint design of the University of Applied Sciences Stralsund for LaTeX Beamer.

This LaTeX beamer theme used to mimics the corporate design of the official PowerPoint template, which was no longer available at the universities website but still circulating in a broken version under the universities students.

As an alternative I developed this beamer theme. It is quite hacky in it's current state but usable.

With the renaming from "Fachhoschule Stralsund" to "Hochschule Stralsund" I asked the public relations department for a new template and was given a preview version. This preview version of the PowerPoint template is still unpublished and subject to change. Therefore don't expect my LaTeX beamer theme to be on par with the final release version until I update it. Consider the current version as preview also.
